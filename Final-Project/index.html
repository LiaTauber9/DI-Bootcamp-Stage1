                    <p> In 1911, the ballet dancer Ruth St. Denis performed at the Mason Opera House in Los Angeles.
                        <br>
                        Inspired by St. Denis’ performance, Graham enrolled in an arts-oriented junior college<br>
                        and later (1916) to the newly opened Denishawn School.
                        Over eight years, as both a student and an instructor, Graham made Denishawn her home.

                    <h4><b>1923 - 1926</b></h4>
                    <p>By 1923, She found her chance dancing in the vaudeville revue Greenwich Village Follies. <br>
                        At the Greenwich Village Follies, Graham was able to design and choreograph her own dances.<br>
                        Then she took a position at the Eastman School of Music, where she was free of the constraints
                        of public performance. <br>
                        At Eastman, Graham was given complete control over her classes and the entire dance program.
                        Graham saw this as an opportunity to engage her best pupils in the experiential dance she was
                        beginning to create.

                    <h4><b>1927</b></h4>
                    <p>For Graham, ballet’s concern with flow and grace left behind more violent traditional passions.
                        Graham believed that through spastic movements, tremblings, and falls she could express
                        emotional and spiritual themes ignored by other dance. <br>
                        She desired to evoke strong emotions, and achieved these visceral responses through the
                        repetition of explicitly sexual and violently disjunctive movements. <br>
                        Beginning with her Eastman students, she formed the now famous Martha Graham School for
                        Contemporary Dance in New York (1927).
